# Gaussian Process Active Sampling
In this project, I use Bayesian active learning and experimental design, and output-weighted acquisition functions to create Gaussian processes that model rare extreme events 

# Getting started
The following in the master directory should take care of everything:
```bash
pip install .
```

# Tutorial
The example folder includes three different case studies:

1- Implementation of active sampling algorithms to create a danger map for a stochastic oscillator (Inout forces that lead to large motion of the oscillator).

2- Implementation of active sampling algorithms to identify the precursors to bursts in 3-dimensional time serie.

3- Implementation of active sampling algorithms to discover tipping point and rare events.
